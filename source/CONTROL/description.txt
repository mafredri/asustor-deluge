Deluge is a full-featured ​BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. It has been designed using the client server model with a daemon process that handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely from any platform.

Login password: deluge
Login for remote clients: admin/admin

The default login password can be changed through the web-interface. You can also connect remotely to the deluge daemon with the Deluge-client by enabling classic-mode in settings.
